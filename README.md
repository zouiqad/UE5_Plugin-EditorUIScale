# UE5_Plugin-EditorUIScale 

This plugin simplifies the process of adjusting the size of the editor's UI, a feature not natively offered by Unreal Engine. The selected scale is saved in the `EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini` file, ensuring that the chosen scale is correctly applied each time the project is opened.
